# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Background

Louise, an aspiring playright, wrote a play called *Fever* and predicts that it will cost about $10,000 to produce. Unfamiliar with the market and data on crowdfunded campaigns she asks a excel data analyst, myself, for assistance.

### Purpose

Using a large data set on crowdfunded kickstarter campaigns, I will provide the client with helpful visuals, subsets and analysis of data on succesful and failed campaigns, and how their date of start and duration, geographical region, amount of backers, funding and goals have affected their outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

How long do failed and succesful campaigs last
which month is best

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Average backers
Higher goals better outcome?

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

When creating a subset of data for plays in Edinburgh, I had a challenge using the VLOOKUP function calling data on average donation, specifically not understanding why my third value was not referring to the column on the original worksheet. For example when coding =VLOOKUP(A2, Kickstarter!B:T, 15, FALSE), I was trying to draw data from column P, the 16th letter and recieving the wrong data. I figured out that the value of the 3rd function started looking from where the second functioned began searching, in this case B:T.
I also had challenges as a first time excel user being careful with the cells and functions, as my subsets in Descriptive statistics were not matching the examples given in the modules, I restarted the project from the beggining more carefully and they matched the second time. 
Another I problem encountered was that when creating graphs, like the Outcomes Based on Goals for example, my graphs would portray too many values and the ranges of donations were in the Y axis, instead of the percents. Right clicking and hitting select data allowed me to pick the right variables to show as well as switching the X and Y axis. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
